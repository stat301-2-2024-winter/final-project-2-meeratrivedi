## Basic repo setup for final project

This repo contains all the work for my final project about apartment listings in Slovakia, and how we can use data about them to predict the quality of living. 

# What the Repo Contains

## Folders

- `data`: In this folder you can find the raw data

- `memos`: In this folder you can find my progress memos. A copy of the data folder is also in this folder


## R Scripts

- `01_data_setup`: reads in the data and has some data cleaning and subsetting

- `02_target_analysis`: explores the target variable: `quality_of_living` as both a numerical and a factor variable
