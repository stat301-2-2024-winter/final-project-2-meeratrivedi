## What is in the Basic Analysis Folder

This is what can be found in the basic analysis folder:

## R Scripts

- `04_basic_recipes`: code for the basic recipe for non-tree models and the basic recipe for tree models

- `05_null_model`: code used for model specifications, workflow, and fit for the null model

- `05_log_model`: code used for model specifications, workflows, and fits for the logistic model

- `05_en_model`: code used for model specifications, workflows, and fits for the elastic net model

- `05_knn_model`: code used for model specifications, workflows, and fits for the nearest neighbor model

- `05_rf_model`: code used for model specifications, workflows, and fits for the random forest model

- `05_btree_model`: code used for model specifications, workflows, and fits for the boosted tree model

- `06_basic_analysis`: code used to complete model analyses for the models

## Folders

- `basic recipes`: contains the `basic_recipe` and the `basic_tree_recipe` as RDA files

- `basic results`: contains the model fits for all 6 models in each R script labeled with a 1 after the model name if there are multiple of that model throughout this project. It also contains `metrics.rda` which contains the assessment metric values for all 6 model fits.
